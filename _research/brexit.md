title: "Is the E ect of Brexit Larger Than Previously Thought? A Synthetic Difference-in-differences Approach with (-out) Covariates"
collection: research
permalink: /research/brexit
excerpt: '*Joint with Esther de Brabander and [Artūras Juodis]{https://sites.google.com/site/ajuodisresearch/}.* This paper re-evaluates the e ect of Brexit on the GDP of the UK using the existing Synthetic
Control (SC) with and without covariates and the Synthetic Difference-in-differences (SDID)
methods. We also introduce an extended SDID estimator with matching on covariates. We find
that the effect of Brexit ranges from 2:45% to 3:28% when measured at the end of year 2018,
depending on the statistical approach used, the definition of the treatment period and on how
covariates are taken into account. The in-sample placebo tests suggest that the SDID methods
are the most accurate across different specifications. In particular, even in cases which the SDID
with covariates leads to the highest accuracy, the improvements are larger when using the SDID
method compared to the inclusion of covariates. The latter is also shown to be harmful for the
SC estimators. Our Monte Carlo exercise corroborates to this set of findings. Finally, we also
indicate how one can easily generate a Zoo of different SC/SDID results by marginally changing
one of the arbitrary set of tuning parameters and specifications'

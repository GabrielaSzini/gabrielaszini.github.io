title: "Asymptotic Properties of a Two-Way Fixed Effects Model of Dyadic Interactions Using U-statistics" 
collection: research
permalink: /research/asymptotic_dyadic
excerpt: 'Even though dyadic regressions are widely used in empirical applications, the (asymptotic) properties of estimation methods only began to be studied recently in the literature. This paper aims to provide in a step-by-step manner how U-statistics tools (Serfling (2009)) can be applied to obtain the asymptotic properties of estimators for a two-way fixed effects model of dyadic interactions. More specifically, we first propose an estimator for the model that relies on pairwise differencing such that the fixed effects are differenced out. As a result, the summands of the influence function will not be independent anymore, showing dependence on the individual level and translating to the fact that usual law of large numbers and central limit
theorems do not straightforwardly apply. To overcome such obstacle we show how to generalize tools of U-statistics for single-index variables to the dyadic context. A key result is that for a directed dyadic structure, there can be different ways of defining the Hájek projection, which will lead to distinct  consistent estimators for the asymptotic variances. The results presented in this paper are easily extended to non-linear models, as in Jochmans (2017).'

excerpt: '*Joint with [Prof. Dr. Vladimir Ponczek](https://sites.google.com/site/vponczek/)*. We estimate the effect of different accountability measures imposed by Brazilian states on educational outputs. We constructed a novel panel dataset at the state level with national exams outputs and indicators of different forms of accountability (*soft* and *hard*). It is employed a differences-in-differences methodology which allows to estimate short and medium-term effects of the treatment. The results indicate that when a *hard* accountability is imposed there is a significant improvement in educational outputs. However, when a *soft* accountability is imposed, there are improvements in the short-term only.'

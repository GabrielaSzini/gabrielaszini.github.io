I am a PhD student in Econometrics at the [University of Amsterdam](https://ase.uva.nl/content/sections/quantitative-economics/quantitative-economics.html?origin=D4DixO%2FESbuaIXcFryAJdQ) and the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home).

My primary research interests include econometrics of **network formation, distribution regressions, sample selection, dyadic regressions and estimation of treatment effects**. In my current project I develop an estimator for distribution regressions with dyadic data which is asymptotically unbiased even in the presence of sparse networks. This method is readily applicable to the estimation of gravity models. I am supervised by [Prof. Dr. Frank Kleibergen](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/l/f.r.kleibergen/f.r.kleibergen.html) and [Dr. ArtÅ«ras Juodis](http://juodis.economists.lt/home).

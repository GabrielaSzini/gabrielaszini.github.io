Welcome!

I am a PhD student in Econometrics at the [University of Amsterdam](https://ase.uva.nl/content/sections/quantitative-economics/quantitative-economics.html?origin=D4DixO%2FESbuaIXcFryAJdQ) and the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home).

My primary research interests include econometrics of **network formation, sample selection, dyadic regressions and identification of treatment effects**. More specifically, my current project aims to correct for sample selection bias in dyadic regressions, which is readily applicable to the estimation of gravity models. I am supervised by [Prof. Dr. Frank Kleibergen](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/l/f.r.kleibergen/f.r.kleibergen.html) and [Dr. ArtÅ«ras Juodis](http://juodis.economists.lt/home).

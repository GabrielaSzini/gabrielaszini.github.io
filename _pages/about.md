**Welcome to my personal homepage!**


I am a Ph.D. candidate in Econometrics at the [University of Amsterdam](https://ase.uva.nl/content/sections/quantitative-economics/quantitative-economics.html?origin=D4DixO%2FESbuaIXcFryAJdQ) and the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home). My advisors are [Prof. Dr. Frank Kleibergen](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/l/f.r.kleibergen/f.r.kleibergen.html) and [Dr. Artūras Juodis](http://juodis.economists.lt/home). I visited [Princeton University](https://economics.princeton.edu/) in the spring semester of 2023, hosted by [Prof. Dr. Bo Honoré](https://honore.scholar.princeton.edu/).

My primary research interests are in econometrics of network models (dyadic regressions) and distribution regression models. My secondary research interests are in the estimation of treatment effects (causal inference) and sample selection models. 

In my Job Market Paper, I propose an estimator for distribution regression models under a networks framework (taken into account through a dyadic setting). I show that this estimator is asymptotically unbiased even in the presence of sparse networks, and also in the extremum quantiles of the distribution of the outcome of interest. This method is applicable to the estimation of international trade flows, firm-level trade flows, and any other network data in which the outcomes are formed through bilateral ties of agents.

My primary research interests include econometrics of network formation, sample selection, dyadic regressions and identification of treatment effects. More specifically, my current project aims to correct for sample selection bias in dyadic regressions, which is readily applicable to the estimation of gravity models. I am supervised by [Prof. Dr. Frank Kleibergen](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/l/f.r.kleibergen/f.r.kleibergen.html) and [Dr. Artūras Juodis](http://juodis.economists.lt/home).
